Vasya's old friend Peter is now a boss of a small IT company. He recently discovered that
his employees (especially programmers) were not taking things seriously and often left the
office much earlier than they were supposed to. He decided to install a special monitoring
system that records the exact time when employees enter and leave the office room.
The system had been working for about a month, just the right time to collect some statistics
when suddenly the hard drive on the local server failed and all the data was lost 
(Rumours say that it was done on purpose by the system administrator who was not very 
happy with his salary).

So Peter asked his friend to suggest a better solution that will use a remote database
to store all the data from the monitoring system. The internals of the monitoring system
are unknown, however it logs all the data to a text file, which can be used.
Vasya's knowledge of programming is not strong enough to solve such a complicated
task, so he asks you to help him.

You are provided with an output file from the monitoring system. It records the employee's name,
the date and times of arrival and departure (it is guaranteed that people arrive and leave within
the same day). You can also use the given methods to read data from the text file (Repository class)

1. Design a data schema of the subject area, work out proper restrictions on data
2. Create a database and save all the data from the text file to it
3. Write a request to the database that will calculate the average number of minutes that each
employee stays at the office.


Hint:
To calculate the difference between two dates in seconds or any other units, subtract
one from another and apply one of the Total... methods, e.g

DateTime dt2, dt1;
...
(dt2-dt1).TotalSeconds
